        <p>
          I am an active, participatory and self-taught woman. I like to learn
          new things and help solve problems. In the team projects in which I
          have participated, I am regularly the leader of the team because i
          like meeting new people and sharing conversations of all kinds. I
          enjoy learning new things about programming, especially frontend
          development (mobile and web)
